## The SOC has received an anonymous report that a user is potentially exfiltrating data from the company. 
### An image of the user’s hard drive has been taken, and you are responsible for analyzing the contents of a perfect copy to find any evidence of malicious activity. 
Using your newly developed skills, search through the folders and files using techniques to uncover 4 pieces of hidden information (each piece of evidence will contain the string {1 of 4} or similar). You will be tested on your ability to discover this information using all of the techniques taught in this course; Linux CLI navigation, identifying incorrect file extensions, identifying hidden files/folders, steganography, and password cracking.

### What will I need for this Challenge?

    Virtualbox (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) or any alternative Virtual Machine software (VMWare etc)
    Kali Linux VM (https://www.kali.org/downloads)
    Challenge Disk Image (.zip file for ease-of-use. Download this to your Kali VM, unzip, and get going! Bottom of page)

### You have been told that the most recent file on the hard-drive was an email file with an attachment in the “Saved Emails” directory. It is suggested you start there. Below are some tips for your investigation:

    Always keep an eye out for hidden files that start with a ‘.’ – use ‘ls -a’ in a terminal to view these files!
    Look at the directories and files both in the Kali Linux GUI, and Command-Line!
    This challenge is based on a narrative. You will be gently guided to find some pieces of evidence, but remember to look in all folders, and check all files, especially ones that look strange!
    If you need to bypass a password-protected .zip use fcrackzip with the rockyou.txt word list.
    If you get stuck, ask people in the forensics module chatroom on our Discord server! Work together, learn together.
