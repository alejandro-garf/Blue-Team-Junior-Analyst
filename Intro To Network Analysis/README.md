## Scenario
```
Alexis is a fictional cybersecurity company with thousands of employees. An attacker has gained unauthorized entry into its premises and has connected their laptop to an unused port on a switch. The attacker now has access to the company’s internal networks. Within the internal network, there is a central server where critical proprietary data is stored. In this capture, the attacker is attempting to collect SSH credentials that they can use to log into the central server.
```
## My Steps:

### 1. Finding the Mad Adress of the attaker 
#### Use Wireshark to open the pcap file
#### Typing in ssh into the display filter cuts packets that we need to inspect to 142
