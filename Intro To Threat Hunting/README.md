### Scenario
```
You are a Junior Threat Hunter working for an organisation.Your Threat Intelligence team has obtained two
malware samples, but they’re too busy dealing with a data breach dump that includes employee credentials,
so you’ll need to hunt for any presence of the malware in any systems. As you’re new to the role, the
Senior Threat Hunter is using advanced tools to assess all systems company-wide, but he has given you
permission to run a live hunt on one system. A disk image was taken, as the system is in a remote office.
You have been told to gather your own IOCs from two malware samples, and conduct a hunt on the files using
Mandiant IOC Editor and Mandiant Redline. You are to report on the findings generated by the IOC Reports.
```
### Challenge Warning
```
THIS CHALLENGE CONTAINS REAL MALWARE. We HIGHLY recommend that you do not download the above files to a work system,
or whilst on a work network, as it may breach corporate policies. We are not responsible for any damage caused by
misuse of our challenge environment. Whilst the malware is easily detected (and confirmed to be removed by Windows Defender),
we have disabled security features to allow this training scenario to work as intended.
```
### Initial Steps
#### I used a Windows virtual machine to download the zip file for the challenge.
#### Downloaded Redline onto my virtualized system
#### We get an [initial message](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alejandro-garf/Blue-Team-Junior-Analyst/main/Intro%20To%20Threat%20Hunting/1_B-DkYh0LLWnB3Z4KWP9qaQ.webp) from Matt:
### Gathering Info
#### Opened a powershell terminal and navigate to the location of the malware files.
#### ran the following commands to get the MD5 and SHA256 hashes of the malware:
```
Get-FileHash -algorithm md5 “filename.extension”
```
```
Get-FileHash “filename.extension”
```
#### Got the filenames and file sizes of the malware by right clicking the file then going to properties.
#### Launched IOC Editor and created IOCs
#### Launch Redline then go to IOC Search Collector and navigate to the folder location of the IOCs
#### Ran and waited to get the Redline results
#### Ran the RunRedlineAudit.bat script.
#### This created a new folder called Sessions in the same location as the previously run script. 
#### We will be using .mans file to view the results of the scan.
####  Went back to Redline and selected "Open Previous Analysis" navigate to the location of the .mans.
#### Viewed the results and used them to answer the questions for the Capstone Activity.
