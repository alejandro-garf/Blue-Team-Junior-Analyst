### Scenario
```
You are a Junior Threat Hunter working for an organisation. Your Threat Intelligence team has obtained two malware samples, but they’re too busy dealing with a data breach dump that includes employee credentials, so you’ll need to hunt for any presence of the malware in any systems. As you’re new to the role, the Senior Threat Hunter is using advanced tools to assess all systems company-wide, but he has given you permission to run a live hunt on one system. A disk image was taken, as the system is in a remote office. You have been told to gather your own IOCs from two malware samples, and conduct a hunt on the files using Mandiant IOC Editor and Mandiant Redline. You are to report on the findings generated by the IOC Reports.
```
### Challenge Warning
```
THIS CHALLENGE CONTAINS REAL MALWARE. We HIGHLY recommend that you do not download the above files to a work system, or whilst on a work network, as it may breach corporate policies. We are not responsible for any damage caused by misuse of our challenge environment. Whilst the malware is easily detected (and confirmed to be removed by Windows Defender), we have disabled security features to allow this training scenario to work as intended.
